        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We are Axl, Elisabeth, Lara, Lieke, Tibe, and Wannesâ€”a team of six passionate Business Engineering students from Ghent University.
            Currently in our third year of studies, we have worked together to create an innovative web application for renting and leasing parking spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea for this project came from a challenge we often face ourselves: the struggle to find a parking spot.
            Whether planning a trip to the seaside or enjoying a day of shopping in the city, the search for convenient parking can be frustrating and time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this in mind, we developed a solution to make parking easier and more accessible for everyone. Our application is designed to improve mobility and simplify everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
            By combining our skills, creativity, and dedication, we have turned our vision into reality, and we are proud to share it with you!
